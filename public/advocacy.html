                    rights – and the rules and regulations that apply to providers.
                    <b>Your aged care rights</b>
                    To understand what you can reasonably expect from your aged care, you need to know your rights –
                    and the rules and regulations that apply to government-funded service providers.

                    Professional aged care advocates frequently use tools like the Charter of Aged Care Rights and
                    the Aged Care Quality Standards to resolve problems. You can, too.

                    When something is not right, or not working for you, it’s okay to speak up.
